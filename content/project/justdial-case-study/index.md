Justdial used to be horizontal search engine with 150mill unique vistors (quaterly). And real estate was
one of the top categories we have decided to launch a NEW PORTAL for Property Search, Research &
Finalisation Jdhomes.com; which is in competition with 99acres, Housing, MagicBricks & NoBroker!

Problem we are facing are
- 80%+ bounce rate & 5% CTRs on Mobile platforms (Mobile Website, Android/iOS App)
- Avg session duration time is 15 seconds

Propose a solution to solve for above scenario! Solutions can be on these lines:
- Recommendations to drive user engagement
- User Flows (if any)
- Success metrics
- Impact projections of the given recommendations

Focus! on either one of Rent, Buy, Commercial or PG/Hostel; whichever you choose!

Focus! on Mobile Only;
