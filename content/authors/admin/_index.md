# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m ADITYA

Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.

I spend my time reading, [writing](https://www.mananagarwal.in/blog) and [tweeting](https://twitter.com/manan_0308).

When I am not doing the above, I can be found making music or treking in the mountain.
