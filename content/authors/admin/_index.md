# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m ADITYA

I am Co-founder of  the [Mockpeers](http://www.mockpeers.com), Mockpeers make it easy for the users to participate in mock interviews. We built a very intuitive way of matching the candidates for the mock interviews and practice mock and give feedback. Before that I was product manager at Oogway, where had the opportunity to led a cross-functional team and work on a variety of innovative products, including evaluate app.

I spend my time reading, [writing](https://www.adityarj.com/post) and [tweeting](https://twitter.com/twitter.com/Adityarajml2).

When I am not doing the above, I can be found making music or treking in the mountain.
